## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings
Struggling a lot with how to code the turning angles however I think I have it now. Now just finding a way to make stroke not show when at different turning stages. 

Update: Need to fix code and tidy it because its CRAZY. 

Have managed to make rules for head tilt in relation to the frames strokeweight- yay! very tedious!!
Looked at other ways to do this but every way I could find meant that I had to redraw the frames everytime a new rule was implimented and my code is already ginormous. 

ideas:

GROW IN DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS DEPENDING ON WHERE U LOOK
if u look right you look at warm colours
if you look kleft you look at cold colours

the more to the side you look the more the nose expands and draws another dimension on top of it, as you face forward slowly each dimension goes
