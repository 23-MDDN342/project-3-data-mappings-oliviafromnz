## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Took away nose rotate - didnt like it and it had no purpose really, have decreased the dimensions in size for both nose and mouth so it decreases in size at is travels through the dimensions, makes the nose look more pointy. Chose to keep eyes the same becasue I like how they are wide and wacky, if anything when you change dimensions, your eyes open rather than close. 

Decreased mouth detail lines as well to make the dimension moving less busy. 

Want to add transaprent layers to make the background of the face look like it goes back lots. Maybe experiment with more purples to add depth. 

Fixed the sliders and the min and max so that everything is within range and still looks good. 

Changed mouth size to decrease to closed mouht when closed, when a bit open its half open and then open mouth. 

Added 1960 images of psychedelic rock icons aswell as festival goers. Added the beatles, Janis Joplin. Need to figure out why only face i sbeing shown - may be because of my code structure. Will be cleaning that up now...
