## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Have linked up eyes and nose location (averaged) as well as made it so that when the nose is turning right then the nose has more depth with an inner layer. 

Next will play with the mouth - odeally want to do these: 
// if mouth is closed then squish the mouth and get rid of inner circle
// if mouth is smiling with teeth then do shocked face squished
// if half teeth then shoked face

We will see - finding it a struggle to manipulate the circs knowing that everytime I refresh its random due to the noise function used....


GROW IN DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS DEPENDING ON WHERE U LOOK
if u look right you look at warm colours
if you look kleft you look at cold colours
