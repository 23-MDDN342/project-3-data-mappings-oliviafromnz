## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Have now made all dimensions other than mouth - as I needed to find a way to manipulate the mouth to portray 

- Open mouth
- Small Open
- Shut mouth

Have done this now using if statements and manipulating the 360 amount divided by the amount of points.

Now just need to alter nose shape - changing amount of points and degree elements.

Experimwented with earrings, however not sure I vibe as much and just want to get the main shape of head before going craxy with additional things as this project is very time sensitive.


Update: Need to fix code and tidy it because its CRAZY.
